# Getting started with Microsoft fabric

### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will explore the core capabilities of Microsoft Fabric by building a complete end-to-end data analytics solution. You will begin by signing up for the Microsoft Fabric trial and creating a workspace, which will serve as your central environment for managing all Fabric resources.

Next, you will create a lakehouse to store and organize your data, followed by building a data pipeline to ingest data from various sources into the lakehouse. You will then create a notebook to perform data exploration, transformation, and analysis using code and Spark-based processing.

Once your data is prepared, you will use SQL to query tables, enabling you to analyze data directly within Fabric. You will then create a visual query to design and execute data transformations using an intuitive, no-code interface. Finally, you will build a report to visualize your insights and share them with stakeholders.

By the end of this lab, you will have hands-on experience with the key components of Microsoft Fabric—from data ingestion and transformation to analysis and reporting—gaining a solid understanding of how to create a unified, end-to-end analytics solution in the cloud.

## Objective

This lab aims to provide hands-on experience with Microsoft Fabric, enabling users to create a workspace, ingest and transform data, and analyze it using notebooks and SQL. Users will learn to build end-to-end data pipelines, visual queries, and reports. By the end, participants will be able to manage, analyze, and visualize data effectively in a unified analytics environment.

1. **Create a Fabric workspace:** Set up a centralized environment in Microsoft Fabric to manage and collaborate on data projects. Participants will establish a centralized platform for managing and collaborating on data projects.

1. **Ingest data with a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric:** Use data pipelines to import and prepare data for analysis within Microsoft Fabric. Participants will automate the import and preparation of data for subsequent analysis.

Participants should have:

- Basic understanding of data concepts such as tables, queries, and reports.
- Understanding of SQL and relational database concepts, and familiarity with data warehousing solutions.
